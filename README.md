# Principal-Component-Analysis
This contribution develops an analysis on the dataset ‘bad-drivers.csv’ (taken from github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) by running the Principal Components Analysis. In particular, the keypoints of the study are the different steps in the computation of the principal components with associated analysis:
1. Computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
2. Definition of the correlation matrix, 
3. Different methods to choose the principal components, 
4. Analysis of the communality, 
5. Computation of scores and loadings.
